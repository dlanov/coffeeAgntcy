The **Peer Group** pattern wires several agents into a **flat, group-addressable conversation** rather than routing
everything through a central orchestrator. Every participant can publish and subscribe on the shared channel; the
group itself is the coordination surface.

In CoffeeAGNTCY this pattern backs the **Group Messaging** workflow under the **Coffee Agntcy → Order Fulfillment**
scenario - the diagram above is from that implementation and is included here as illustrative topology while the
full pattern-level write-up is pending.

See the per-workflow reference doc for the concrete implementation:
