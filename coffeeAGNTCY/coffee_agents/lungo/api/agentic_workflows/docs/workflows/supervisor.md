## Pattern

**Pattern category:** Orchestration & Control Flow

>
> **Status: API-only.** This doc is served via `POST /patterns/{name}/chat` for the implemented

> Reference Library is tracked as a follow-up.

The **Supervisor** pattern places **one orchestrating agent** at the centre of a workflow and routes work out to a
small set of **clear callees**. The supervisor turns a vague ask into a structured plan, delegates per-step, collects
results, and produces a single coherent answer.

In CoffeeAGNTCY this pattern backs the **Publish Subscribe** and **Publish Subscribe Streaming** workflows under the
**Coffee Agntcy → Purchasing** scenario - the diagram above is from those implementations and is included here as
illustrative topology while the full pattern-level write-up is pending.

See the per-workflow reference docs for the concrete implementations:

- [Publish Subscribe](./publish_subscribe.md)
- [Publish Subscribe Streaming](./publish_subscribe_streaming.md)
