## Pattern

**Pattern category:** Internet of Cognition

A **session context buffer** is a **temporary, shared scratchpad** for one negotiation or task-bids, floors, deadlines,
last counters-without polluting long-term catalogs or treating ephemeral chatter as permanent truth. It answers: what is
the **current** state of this deal for everyone who is allowed in the room?

Participating agents read and write a **scoped session object** alongside the conversational thread. **Ownership,
time-to-live, and field-level permissions** keep the buffer honest and retirable when the deal closes or aborts. The
pattern fits auctions, RFQs, incident bridges-anywhere “where we are now” must be shared but not carved into stone
prematurely.

## Use case

**Coffee Agntcy** is a coffee company set in a familiar supply chain: **upstream**, it depends on **farms in different
countries**, each with its own harvest rhythm, quality, and availability; **midstream**, it **buys and allocates** lots-
matching supply to commercial needs under real constraints; **downstream**, it must eventually **honor customer
promises** through operations, logistics, and finance it does not always own end to end. The company sits **between**
those worlds: much of the drama is ordinary commerce-contracts, risk, partners, and tools-rather than a single team
inside one building holding every fact.

## Scenario

Live **origin negotiation** needs everyone to see the same “where we are now” until the handshake or walk-away moment.

A **Workflow** section will describe how this pattern is realized once a concrete layout exists.
